        <h1>WHO IS MARIMO?</h1>
        <p> Marimo seems to resonate in some way with most of us. <br>
            Whether you always adhere to his strict doctrine, or if you're just trying to (re)impose them in some facet of your lifeâ€¦ your kitchen, your linen cupboard, your handbag.<br>
            Marimo's General Store presents his carefully curated picks of products that are at once practical and pleasing in both form and function. <br>
            There's an underlying sense of quality and timelessness, they're tried and true.</p>
